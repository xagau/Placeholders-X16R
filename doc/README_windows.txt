Placeholder Core
=============

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run placeh-qt.exe.

Placeholder Core is the original Placeh client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Placeh transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
